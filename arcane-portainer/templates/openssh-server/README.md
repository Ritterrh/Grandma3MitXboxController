# Openssh-server

[Openssh-server](https://www.openssh.com/) is a sandboxed environment that allows ssh access without giving keys to the entire server. Giving ssh access via private key often means giving full access to the server. This container creates a limited and sandboxed environment that others can ssh into. The users only have access to the folders mapped and the processes running inside this container.
